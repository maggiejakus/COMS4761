# COMS4761

A ReadMe file that tells exactly what is each file, how to compile (if relevant) and test-run the project on sample inputs to get the sample output, 
how to really run the project on large files, if relevant, what are the parameters, what are the system requirements (e.g. are you using a particular
version of MatLab/Python/R/Ruby/Java/C++/Cobol? Do you run on a particularly powerful machine/cloud instance? Which standard or add-on libraries would
you need to have been previously installed?)
